/*
App requirements:
- The app should display the name, symbol, and price of the stock, with a timestamp as per the screenshot.
- The triangle compares the current stock price to its previous price. If the price has increased, it should be a green triangle pointing up, if the price has decreased it should be a red triangle pointing down, and if there has been no change it should be a grey triangle pointing to the right.
- The price should update every 1.5 seconds.
*/

/*
Challenge:
1. Find a way to get fresh stock data every 1.5 seconds.
2. Call the renderStockTicker function with the fresh data.
3. Add logic to renderStockTicker to display the correct information.

⚠ You will need to write code here in index.js and in fakeStockAPI.js.

  const stockDisplaySymbol = document.getElementById('symbol')
  const stockDisplayPrice = document.getElementById('price')
  const stockDisplayPriceIcon = document.getElementById('price-icon')
